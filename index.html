                    <h3>WHAT IS HIV/AIDS?</h3>
                    HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). <br>
                        There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life. <br>
                        But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners.

                <div class="RESEARCH-col">
                    <h3>WHERE DID HIV/AIDS COME FROM?</h3>
                   HIV infection in humans came from a type of chimpanzee in Central Africa. <br> Studies show that HIV may have jumped from chimpanzees to humans as far back as the late 1800s.
                        The chimpanzee version of the virus is called simian immunodeficiency virus. It was probably passed to humans when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came in contact with their infected blood. <br>
                        Over decades, HIV slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world. <br> The virus has existed in the United States since at least the mid to late 1970s.

                <h2>RESILIENT AGAINST IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE</h2>
              Since HIV/AIDS attack the our own immune system it can be difficult for our immune response to eliminate this disease. It also has a lot of ability ( mutation) in order to help/avoid the immune response.



              

                </div>

                <div class="RESEARCH-col">
                    <h2>ELUSIVENESS DUE TO ITS MUTATION</h2>
                    Popular explanations describe HIV as a master of disguise. An article by John R. Mascola and David C. Montefiori noted that one of the two types of human immunodeficiency virus called HIV-1 readily mutates to escape the immune system and evolves further to thwart off attacks by immune cells. Note that HIV-1 is the most prevalent cause of HIV infection in the world. <br>
                        To be specific, HIV-1 uses a shield of continually shifting sugar molecules called glycans to prevent antibodies from attacking. This is one of the possible reasons why candidate HIV-1 vaccines remained ineffective. <br>
                        The rapid adaptability of the virus stems from its underlying biological mechanism. HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to replicate its genome from several RNA bases of other HIVs. This replication via reverse transcriptase is rapid and random, thus producing a large number of distinct copies. Note that viral recombination produces genetic variation. <br>
                        Replications over a period create a pool of diverse HIV strains or copies called quasi-species. Some HIV copies are highly functional and very infectious while others are partly to slightly infectious. There are also HIV copies that are mere junk. The immune system has to respond to all of these genetically diverse copies regardless of their degree of infectiousness, thus leaving it overstrained.
                        


                    
                    
                    
                 


                </div>

                <div class="RESEARCH-col">
                    <h2> IT ATTACKS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ITSELF</h2>
                  Another reason why HIV infection is hard to cure is that HIV attacks the immune system itself. Remember that the immune system, especially the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system, provide natural defense against pathogens and foreign objects such as allergens. Most viral infections would not survive this defense mechanism of the human body. <br>
                        However, one of the targets of HIV is a type of cells called CD4+ T cells or helper T cells. These cells play an important role in the immune system and adaptive immunity because they are responsible for coordinating the activities of other immune cells such as B cell antibody class switching, cytotoxic T cell activation and growth, and regulating the bactericidal activities of phagocytes. <br>
                        Different types of immune cells are constantly communicating with one another to coordinate their activities, thus forming overlapping networks. Helper T Cells are at the center of most of these networks. They specifically work by relaying instructions to different groups of immune cells such as by telling killer T cells to target a pathogen or ordering B cells to make antibodies. <br>
                        Because HIV infects and replicates within helper T cells, apart from other types of immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, an HIV infection disrupts most of the overlapping networks of the immune cells and thereby, important immune processes. The immune cells are essentially left without instructions of what to do. This impairment leads to the further replication of HIV in the human body. <br>
                        Remember that helper T cells orchestrate the immune system by controlling other T cell subsets, B cells, and innate immune responses. These are the reasons why an HIV infection also results in the development of AIDS. HIV generally weakens the immune system and causes the body to become susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancer proliferation.

        <div class="RESEARCH-col">
          I have asked many organization regarding about this issue via GMAIL and here is what ive gathered:  For every response that ive had, currently, there is no effective cure for HIV/AIDS. It can only be maintained, via medications and therapy.  due to the complexity of the disease, there is still no cure for it. However, there are small documented cases that people have been "cured" of HIV/AIDS, using surgical procedures.

        <div class="RESEARCH-col">
            <h1>ACCORDING TO CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION:</h1>
          <p> There is a very small number of documented cases of people with HIV who appear to be in long-term remission from the virus and have been cured. In some cases, the patients received stem cell transplants (also called bone marrow transplants) to treat cancer. In other cases, the patient received a combination of stem cells from both bone marrow and umbilical cord blood to treat cancer. The donors in these cases had a rare genetic resistance to HIV. Stem cell transplants can be risky and have severe side effects, including severe illness and risk of death from the procedure. These procedures are risky, experimental, and used only for people with severe cancers when other treatments have failed. Stem cell transplants are NOT feasible or realistic treatments for people with HIV. </p>

         <br> <p>  There is a person named, Timothy Ray Brown, also known as, "The Berlin Patient". He was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 and began antiretroviral therapy. In 2006, Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His physician, Dr. Gero Hütter, at Charité Hospital in Berlin, arranged for him to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the "delta32" mutation on the CCR5 receptor.[16] This mutation, found at relatively high frequencies in Northern Europeans (16%), results in a mutated CCR5 protein.[17] The majority of HIV cannot enter a human cell without a functional CCR5 gene. An exception to this is a small minority of viruses that use alternate receptors, such as CXCR4 or CCR2.[18] Those individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 mutation are resistant to HIV and rarely progress to AIDS. Brown received two stem cell transplants from one donor homozygous for the delta32 mutation: one in 2007 and one in 2008.[16] Brown stopped taking his antiretroviral medication on the day of his first transplant. Three months after the first stem cell transplant, levels of HIV rapidly plummeted to undetectable levels while his CD4 T cell count increased. In addition, blood and tissue samples from areas of the body where HIV is known to hide were tested. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.[16] As of 2011, Brown remains off antiretroviral therapy and is considered cured,[19][20][21] although some debate exists whether there is no trace of the virus in his body (a "sterilizing" cure) or whether he simply no longer needs treatment. </p>

            As the first full day of presentations at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) began to wrap up, we spoke with Dr. Carl Dieffenbach about some of the new HIV research highlights presented, including the case of a patient reported to be possibly cured of HIV infection. Dr. Dieffenbach is the Director of the Division of AIDS at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). He also discussed the promising findings from a large study evaluating a “universal test and treat” strategy, as well as other results showing improved viral suppression and retention in care when point-of-care viral load testing is offered.
